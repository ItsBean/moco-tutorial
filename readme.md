# MoCo Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial on implementing the Momentum Contrast (MoCo) algorithm for unsupervised learning. MoCo is a contrastive learning method that learns representations by maximizing the similarity between an anchor and its positive example while minimizing the similarity between the anchor and negative examples.

See `tutorial_moco_memory_bank.ipynb` for a step-by-step guide on implementing MoCo with an optional memory bank.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to unsupervised learning and contrastive learning
2. Overview of the MoCo algorithm
3. Implementing the MoCo algorithm using PyTorch
4. Creating a custom ResNet backbone
5. Implementing the MoCo projection head
6. Utilizing a memory bank for improved performance
7. Training the model and visualizing the results

## Requirements

To run the tutorial, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

# Usage
To follow the tutorial, open the tutorial_moco_memory_bank.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can start a Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a browser window where you can navigate to the tutorial_moco_memory_bank.ipynb file and start working through the tutorial.
